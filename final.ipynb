    "After graduating, a sizable percentage of undergraduate students join the workforce without having a basic understanding of the earning potential of their learned talents. This is especially true for those studying computer science who aren't sure what career path to take. It is crucial that these students have access to trustworthy information about the financial possibilities for various career pathways, including data science, cyber security, and software engineering, as compensation is one of the most crucial aspects in employment selection.\n",
    "By using the data science pipeline to examine the available data, our goal is to give computer science students the greatest financial options possible. Through an examination of average pay for various job titles, degrees of expertise, and organizations, we will look into how to maximize their earning potential. Furthermore, by investigating which states offer the best incomes for a certain degree, we will examine how geography influences income. We will also look at non-job-related variables like ethnicity, gender, and educational attainment that could have an ongoing impact on income.\n",
    "By providing comprehensive and accurate information, our aim is to assist computer science students in making informed decisions about their future career paths and maximizing their earning potential. Ultimately, we believe that this will help to create a more equitable and prosperous job market for all computer science graduates.\n"

    "For this step, we looked for a dataset that is related to the salary of computer science jobs. More specifically, we look into a dataset from Kaggle related to Data Science and Stem Salaries. It contains more than 62,000 salary records from top companies. It contains useful data such as gender, race, level of experience, base salary etc… that we think is enough for our tutorial.
