This is also the case for a lot of computer science students who don't have a clear idea of what path to follow. One of the biggest factors about finding a new job is the salary. There are many paths a computer science new grad can take such as data science, cyber security, software engineering, etc. Our goal is to give those students the best financial options when it comes to choosing their path. \n",
